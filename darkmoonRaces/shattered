# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
#
# Pretty Straightforward Druid deck - lots of defense and draw to get through your deck and drop C'Thun. There are just
# a few cool combinations I would comment on:
#
# Solar Eclipse + Cenarion Ward - This gives you 16 armor and 2 8 cost minions, which can make you pretty tough when
# you're finishing your deck and getting ready to drop C'Thun.
#
# Lightning Bloom + Solar Eclipse + Overgrowth - this can sky rocket your mana on turn 4 straight to 8.  If you get the
# coin, you can do it on turn 3.
#
# Lightning Bloom + Youthful Brewmaster + C'Thun - because there are warriors out there still doing the massive armor
# defense, sometimes dropping C'Thun once just isn't enough, so after you drop it and hit them for 30, then you can
# LB + YB and do it again in 2 turns (unless you have an extra lightning bloom).
