# To use this deck, copy it to your clipboard and create a new deck in Hearthstone
#
# The game plan is to mulligan for the Elemental Allies quest and/or card draw to get you there. Manage the board state
# for the first 5/6 turns and on turn 7lay down a bunch of elementals (confection cyclones, sugar elementals, etc),
# then Grand Finale on turn 8.
#
# If you can get Deck of Lunacy first and then use Elemental Allies to draw three of the new spells, it's really
# powerful up front.
#
# This deck is fun to play because it's not the usual all spell or C'Thun deck. I don't think it's super powerful, but
# there are a lot of classes (druid, rogue, mage, hunter) that have a hard time handling Grand Finale, because they will
# try to kill off your little elementals you drop on turn 7 and often they are left with their pants down when you drop
# 3-5 8/8 elementals with Grand Finale on turn 8.
